# Financial Performance Analysis for Banks

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the financial performance of bank customers, focusing on identifying high-value clients, predicting credit risk, and optimizing marketing strategies. By using data science techniques, the analysis provides actionable insights that can help banks enhance their decision-making processes, manage risks better, and improve overall customer service.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer financial behavior to identify high-value customers and predict credit risk.
- Understand patterns and trends related to income, credit score, transactions, and savings balance.
- Build predictive models to forecast the likelihood of loan default and segment customers based on their financial attributes.
- Provide recommendations to improve credit policies and optimize marketing campaigns.

## Dataset
The dataset is simulated to represent customer data in a banking environment. It includes features such as age, annual income, credit score, transaction frequency, savings balance, loan amount, and a binary indicator of default risk. The data is structured to mimic real-world financial attributes and enable meaningful analysis of customer behavior.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and scaling features to ensure data quality and uniformity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing patterns in financial data to understand customer characteristics and trends.
- **Modeling:** Implementing a Random Forest classifier to predict credit risk and using KMeans clustering for customer segmentation.
- **Evaluation:** Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for classification performance, while using inertia and silhouette score for clustering evaluation.

## Results
The analysis yielded the following key results:
- The Random Forest model achieved a high accuracy in predicting loan defaults, with a ROC-AUC score indicating strong model performance.
- High credit score, annual income, and transaction frequency were identified as the most significant predictors of low credit risk.
- Customer segmentation revealed four distinct clusters, ranging from low-income, high-risk customers to high-income, low-risk customers.

## Key Insights
- Customers with higher income and good credit scores are less likely to default, indicating that they represent valuable segments for the bank.
- Customers with frequent transactions and high savings balances are potential targets for upselling financial products, as they demonstrate higher engagement with banking services.
- Low-income, low-credit-score customers present a higher risk of default, suggesting the need for stricter credit assessments or targeted financial education.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to illustrate financial performance and model outcomes:
- **Feature Importance Plot:** Highlights the most significant features in predicting credit risk.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Evaluates the accuracy of the classification model.
- **ROC Curve:** Shows the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
- **Customer Segmentation Plot:** Visualizes customer clusters based on income and credit score.
